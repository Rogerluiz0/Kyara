__Project:__ CLI kyara is an initiative to replicate the basic operations of Bash, standard terminal in most Linux distributions. From developer to developer. This cli is developed using [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) with [Gluegun](https://infinitered.github.io/gluegun/#/).

## Features

* __📴 Offline Mode.__ Kyara works completely offline;
* __💾 Filesystem.__ Manipulate files on your system easily;
* __⚒ System.__ Search for information about the current system;
* __🗄 Patching.__ Manipulating file contents.

## Implementation ideas

# Why use Kyara?

You might want to use Kyara if:

* You need a command line in windows similar to Bash;
* You want to have powerful tools at your fingertips;
* And you don't want to have to do complex installations to have a simple command line.

If so ... welcome!

## Installing Kyara

You can use npm:

```console
npm install --global kyara
```

Check installation:

```console
kyara --version
```

I recommend that you install globally, so you can use it anywhere on your machine and gluegun does not support installation for specific folders.

## Using Kyara

Read the [Usage Guide](docs/commands.md) for detailed instructions on how to use Kyara.

## Contributing to Kyara

Contributions are always welcome, no matter how large or small.

1. Fork this repository;
2. Create a branch with your feature: `git checkout -b my-feature`;
3. Commit your changes: `git commit -m 'feat: My new feature'`;
4. Push to your branch: `git push origin my-feature`.

After the merge of your pull request is done, you can delete your branch.

You can report a bug [here](https://github.com/abantes/kyara/issues).

## Prior art

Kyara wouldn't exist if it wasn't for excellent prior art. Kyara has been inspired by the following projects:

* [npm](https://github.com/npm/cli)
* [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)
